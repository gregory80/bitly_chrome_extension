--- remembering your edits in popup window..

        could make it like a carosouel, as long as the tab id, tab url doesn't change it stays in one of the 5 spots (a fixed length array?)
        
        save everything (space limitaions, also concerns about space limits)
        
        pull the currtab id, lookup based on that, see that the 'url' matches and the timestamp is still good (less than 1 day old?)

=== Error Handling / Post Share Experience ====
Currently, raw, returns success or failure. Does not check for minor errors, like not sending to one account if multiple accounts are specified

Improvement Ideas:
    1. Replace textarea with links and account used, make area scrollable to it over fits box exactly (no-redrawn)
        Add a close button, returns to text area with original 'shared' message
    
    2. display a series of 'messages' to user, in order of response (ticker-like style. Similar to bit.ly error handling)
    

    **3. Add link to 'share history', takes user to page of history of all shares, message and result. 
        Adjust current message to include a # of #. 
            ex: Successfully shared to # of # accounts. more >>

=== Handling Images / Screen Captures ===

it might be possible to port an image lib to JS and have an ext worker resize, crop etc etc the results from capture visible tab area.

The worker should be able to make a local ajax connection and load the library (if it hasn't already) then process any results and return a string.

If this was possible, it would mean the server aspect could be removed and data could be uploaded directly to twitpic or Facebook etc etc

1. Build Test Case to capture visible tab area, return string
2. attempt to decode string from base64, examine if 'editing' is possible (aka removing duplicate values in order to downsize etc, other BASIC operations)
